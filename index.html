                <h3>Meeting Notes</h3>
                <p>
                    Last meeting, we came up with two project ideas: make a <i>calculator</i> or a <i>clock</i>.
                    The general consensus was that both of these ideas were too basic. 
                    This meeting, we were able to come up with much more interesting ideas, 
                        such as making a basic <b>messaging app</b> or creating a simple <b>mobile game</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided on going forward with the <strong>messaging app</strong> idea. 
                    While we were discussing what short term goals we wanted for the beginning of the project,
                        Hank made a good point that we should try to <em>limit our scope</em> as much as possible,
                        so that we would not cut out more work than we could handle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were able to come up with a few short term goals for the upcoming work week:
                    <br>
                    1. Set up a GitHub repository and add all members
                    <br>
                    2. Research the types of functionality that a messaging app should have at minimum
                    <br>
                    3. Use other messaging apps and see which features we would like to implement in our own design
                </p>
                <p>
                    With enough time to spare towards the end of the meeting, we were able to divide up the work between our members.
                    Rochelle will be mainly in charge of the backend code, Hank could work on the database design, and George would
                    take control of the frontend.
